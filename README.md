🐴 Manga & Horses: XML Project
Hi! I'm a develpment student who is currently obsessed with horses because I'm reading a book about them, so I decided to make this project about Horse Riding Mangas. I think they are super cute and I wanted to share that passion through this code!

What I did:
XML Document: Created a structured file with info about two horse mangas.

XML Namespaces: Added namespaces to organize the data correctly.

HTML Page: Built a simple website to show the manga info using basic tags.
